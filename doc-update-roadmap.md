# Substrate documentation roadmap

The Developer Hub documentation site has gone through a significant transformation.
If you have bookmarked pages in the old site, the page you are looking is most likely no longer available at that location.
This roadmap provides suggestions to help you navigate to the information you're looking for in the new site.

* If you arrived here from a post on the Substrate and Polkadot Stack Exchange, please either edit the post directly with the correct link, or add a comment to the post to notify the author and community that the location has changed.
* If you arrived here from an external resource—such as a blog or a repository that is maintained externally—please inform the authors of that content.
* If you arrived here from a link in the Substrate Developer Hub, please [open an issue to report the broken link](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-docs/issues/new?title=Broken%20Link&template=broken-link.yaml&labels=Broken%20Link).
